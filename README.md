You can use this web app to predict HDB prices. Data is updated as of 2020.

Note: 


       1. Ensure you follow the entry format of the app. For example, the floor format is XX to XX, you have to input '04 to 06' , it will bug out if you enter , say '4 to 06' or '4 to 6'. 

      2. It is case sensitive. For example , you should input Ang Mo Kio , but anG MO kIo will not work. 
      
      3. Only data that exist in the data files can be predicted, no extrapolation prediction are available. for example , highest floor in data is 45, but if you predict a the pricing for a house with 60 floor, the app will bug out.
